If the total amount of such individual's earnings during such year (exclusive of earnings for services described in subdivision (3)) is in excess of $4,800 (after deduction of disability related work expenses), the number of months in such year with respect to which an annuity is not payable by reason of such first and third sentences shall not exceed one month for each $400 of such excess, treating the last $200 or more of such excess as $400; and if the amount of the annuity has changed during such year, any payments of annuities which become payable solely by reason of the limitations contained in this sentence shall be made first with respect to the month or months for which the annuity is larger."

In computing the monthly compensation, no part of any month's compensation in excess of $300 for any month before July 1, 1954, or in excess of $350 for any month after June 30, 1954, and before June 1, 1959, or in excess of $400 for any month after May 31, 1959, and before November 1, 1963, or in excess of $450 for any month after October 31, 1963, and before October 1, 1965, or in excess of (i) $450, or (ii) an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable &#8220;wages&#8221; as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 3121], whichever is greater, for any month after September 30, 1965, shall be recognized. If for any calendar year after 1984 an employee has received compensation of less than one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable &#8220;wages&#8221; as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in one or more months of the calendar year, the total compensation paid such employee in the calendar year (without regard to the limitation on the amount of compensation provided in the preceding sentence) shall be deemed to have been paid in equal proportions with respect to all months in the year in which the employee will have been in the service of one or more employers for compensation or will have performed service for compensation as an employee representative, but this sentence shall not operate to increase the employee's compensation for any month above an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable &#8220;wages&#8221; as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the employee earned compensation in service after June 30, 1937, and after the last day of the calendar year in which he attained age sixty-five, such compensation and service shall be disregarded in computing the average monthly compensation if the result of taking such compensation into account in such computation would be to diminish his annuity. Where an employee claims credit for months of service rendered within two years prior to his retirement from the service of an employer, with respect to which the employer's return pursuant to section 231h of this title has not been entered on the records of the Board before the employee's annuity could otherwise be certified for payment, the Board may, in its discretion (subject to subsequent adjustment at the request of the employee) include such months in the computation of the annuity without further verification and may consider the compensation for such months to be the average of the compensation for months in the last period for which the employer has filed a return of the compensation of such employee and such return has been entered on the records of the Board."

Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States.

Such obligations issued for purchase by the accounts shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the accounts, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing notes of the United States then forming a part of the public debt that are not due or callable until after the expiration of three years from the end of such calendar month, except that where such rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest on such obligation shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such rate: Provided, That the rate of interest on such obligations shall in no case be less than 3 per centum per annum. At the request of the Board the Secretary shall purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United States, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, or other obligations which are lawful investments for trust funds of the United States, on original issue or at the market price: Provided, That the interest yield of such obligations shall not be less than the interest rate determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. At the request of the Board, the Secretary shall sell at the market price such obligations in the accounts (other than special obligations issued exclusively to the accounts) as the Board designates. The Board shall from time to time request the Secretary to redeem such special obligations issued exclusively to the accounts as the Board designates and upon such request the Secretary shall redeem such obligations at par plus accrued interest. All requests of the Board to the Secretary, provided for in this subsection, shall be mandatory upon the Secretary. It shall be the duty of the Board to determine at all times what proportion of the accounts shall be invested in other than special obligations issued to the accounts and further to determine which of such obligations available to the accounts consistent with the foregoing requirements will provide the greatest rate of return on the funds invested."

Solely for the purpose of determining the compensation received by an employee in a base year, the term &#8220;compensation&#8221; shall include any separation allowance or subsistence allowance paid under any benefit schedule provided under section 701&#160;1 of title VII of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 797] and any termination allowance paid under section 702 of that Act [45 U.S.C. 797a], but does not include any other benefits payable under that title [45 U.S.C. 797 et seq.]. The total amount of any subsistence allowance payable under a benefit schedule provided pursuant to section 701&#160;1 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 shall be considered as being compensation in the month in which the employee first timely filed a claim for such an allowance. Such term does not include remuneration for service which is performed by a nonresident alien individual for the period he is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F) or (J) of section 1101(a)(15) of title 8 and which is performed to carry out the purpose specified in subparagraph (F) or (J) as the case may be. A payment made by an employer to an individual through the employer's pay roll shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for service rendered by such individual as an employee of the employer in the period with respect to which the payment is made. An employee shall be deemed to be paid, &#8220;for time lost&#8221; the amount he is paid by an employer with respect to an identifiable period of absence from the active service of the employer, including absence on account of personal injury, and the amount he is paid by the employer for loss of earnings resulting from his displacement to a less remunerative position or occupation. If a payment is made by an employer with respect to a personal injury and includes pay for time lost, the total payment shall be deemed to be paid for time lost unless, at the time of payment, a part of such payment is specifically apportioned to factors other than time lost, in which event only such part of the payment as is not so apportioned shall be deemed to be paid for time lost. Compensation earned in any calendar month before 1947 shall be deemed paid in such month regardless of whether or when payment will have been in fact made, and compensation earned in any calendar year after 1946 but paid after the end of such calendar year shall be deemed to be compensation paid in the calendar year in which it will have been earned if it is so reported by the employer before February 1 of the next succeeding calendar year or, if the employee establishes, subject to the provisions of section 356 of this title, the period during which such compensation will have been earned."

In any such case the Board or the person so designated shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the proceeding and, if a hearing is to be held, of the time and place of the hearing. At the request of any party properly interested the Board shall provide for a hearing, and may provide for a hearing on its own motion.

Within one year after November 8, 1978, the Secretary shall prepare a report with appropriate recommendations and shall submit such report to the Congress. Such report shall specify the most appropriate means of indemnifying the Corporation for such liabilities in a manner which shall prevent the cross-subsidization of passenger services with revenues from freight services operated by the Corporation."

When making such a determination, the Secretary shall evaluate and consider in the following order of priority (A) the availability of funds from other sources at a cost which is reasonable under principles of prudent railroad financial management in light of the railroad's projected rate of return for the project to be financed and the railroad's rate of return on total capital (represented by the ratio which such carrier's net income, including interest on a long-term debt, bore to the sum of average shareholder's equity, long-term debt, and accumulated deferred income tax for fiscal year 1975) as determined in accordance with the uniform system of accounts promulgated by the Commission, (B) the interest of the public in supplementing such other funds as may be available in order to increase the total amount of funds available for railroad financing, and (C) the public benefits, including any significant railroad restructuring, to be realized from the project to be financed in relation to the public costs of such financing and whether the proposed project will return public benefits sufficient to justify such public costs. Except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, the Secretary, in determining the extent to which a project will provide public benefits, shall give the highest priority to projects which will enhance the ability of the applicant carrier or other carriers to provide essential freight services. With respect to funds appropriated for financial assistance under this section which were authorized pursuant to section 803(a) and (b) of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, applications for such funds for the purpose of coal transportation shall be deemed to be for the provision of essential freight services. The Secretary, in granting financial assistance to any applicant, shall assign the highest priority, among applications for assistance which would return equal public benefits, to applications for assistance for providing safety improvements and signals, including underpasses or overpasses at railroad crossings at which injury or loss of life has frequently occurred or is likely to occur. The Secretary shall assign the highest priorities (i) to those meritorious applications of carriers operating under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act unable to generate such funds in the private sector and (ii) to those meritorious applications for funds to provide for the restructuring of rail freight facilities and systems which handle more than two million rail cars annually, which are located in more than one State, and which are separated by the Mississippi River."

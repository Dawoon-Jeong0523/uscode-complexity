Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt, except that when such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of one percent, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of one percent next lower than such average rate. Such special obligations shall be issued only if the Secretary determines that the purchase of other interest bearing obligations of the United States, or of obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States or original issue or at the market price, is not in the public interest."

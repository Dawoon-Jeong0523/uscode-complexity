The terms and conditions of the sales shall be prescribed by the Secretary. The specifications and minimum requirements to be included in the invitations for bids, and the determination of appropriate units for sale, shall be developed and made jointly by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture. Such plans when prepared by the purchaser shall include provisions for the conservation of soil and water resources as well as for the management of the timber resources as hereinbefore set forth in this section. Such plans shall be satisfactory to and have the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture as complying with the minimum standards included in said specifications and requirements before the prospective purchaser shall be entitled to have his bid considered by the Secretary of the Interior and the failure on the part of the purchaser to prepare and submit a satisfactory plan to the Secretary of Agriculture shall constitute grounds for rejection of such bid. Such plans shall be incorporated as conditions in the conveyancing instruments executed by the Secretary and shall be binding on the grantee and all successors in interest.

The purchase price paid by the grantee shall be deemed to represent the full appraised fair market value of the lands, undiminished by the right of reversion retained by the United States in a nontrust status, and the retention of such right of reversion shall not be the basis for any claim against the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture shall be responsible for enforcing such conditions. Upon any reversion of title pursuant to this subsection, the lands shall become national forest lands subject to the laws that are applicable to lands acquired pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961), as amended."

The cost of the appraisal review shall be paid from tribal funds which are made available for such purpose, subject to full reimbursement by the United States, and the appropriation of funds for that purpose is authorized. Upon the basis of a review of the appraisal heretofore made of the forest units and marsh lands involved and such other materials as may be readily available, including additional market data since the date of the prior appraisal, but without making any new and independent appraisal, each appraiser shall estimate the fair market value of such forest units and marsh lands as if they had been offered for sale on a competitive market without limitation on use during the interval between the adjournment of the Eighty-fifth Congress and the termination date specified in section 564e(b) of this title. This value shall be known as the realization value. If the three appraisers are not able to agree on the realization value of such forest units and marsh lands, then such realization values shall be determined by averaging the values estimated by each appraiser. The Secretary shall report such realization values to the chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs not later than January 15, 1959. No sale of forest units that comprise the Klamath Indian Forest designated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be made under the provisions of this subchapter prior to April 1, 1959."

Such declarations shall represent the aspirations of a community for the kinds of persons such community wants its children to increasingly become, and shall include such purposes as assuring that all learners are becoming accomplished in ways important to themselves and respected by their parents and communities, shaping worthwhile and satisfying lives for themselves, exemplifying the best values of the community and humankind, and becoming increasingly effective in shaping the character and quality of the world all learners share."
